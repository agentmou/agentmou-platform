# apps/web Architecture

`apps/web` is the user-facing surface of the monorepo. It combines the public
marketing site, authentication flows, a tenant-scoped control center with
clinic and platform modes, and a small set of Next.js API routes used by the
frontend itself.

## Responsibilities

- Render the public marketing experience under `app/(marketing)`.
- Handle login, registration, password reset, and the B2C OAuth return flow
  under `app/(auth)`.
- Render the authenticated tenant experience under `app/app/[tenantId]/`,
  choosing between the clinic shell and the original platform shell.
- Consume `services/api` through typed client helpers in `lib/api/`, including
  the clinic backend fetchers added for the new tenant-scoped domain routes.
- Expose web-owned API routes for marketing chat and the public catalog cards.
- Keep demo and operational catalog experiences separated through the
  `DataProvider` abstraction.
- Keep clinic and internal-platform navigation coherent for vertical tenants
  through tenant-aware routing, capability resolution, and redirect helpers.

## Route Layout

### Public marketing routes

```text
app/(marketing)/
├── page.tsx
├── docs/page.tsx
├── pricing/page.tsx
└── security/page.tsx
```

These routes use the marketing layout and default to demo-backed read models.

### Auth routes

```text
app/(auth)/
├── layout.tsx
├── login/page.tsx
├── register/page.tsx
├── reset-password/page.tsx
└── auth/callback/page.tsx
```

Important behavior:

- `login` and `register` call `services/api` auth endpoints.
- `auth/callback` receives the B2C OAuth redirect after the API completes the
  provider handshake.
- `reset-password` handles password reset tokens issued by the API.

### Tenant control-center routes

```text
app/app/
├── page.tsx
└── [tenantId]/
    ├── agenda/page.tsx
    ├── layout.tsx
    ├── approvals/page.tsx
    ├── bandeja/page.tsx
    ├── configuracion/page.tsx
    ├── dashboard/page.tsx
    ├── fleet/page.tsx
    ├── installer/new/page.tsx
    ├── marketplace/page.tsx
    ├── marketplace/agents/[agentId]/page.tsx
    ├── marketplace/packs/[packId]/page.tsx
    ├── marketplace/workflows/[workflowId]/page.tsx
    ├── observability/page.tsx
    ├── pacientes/page.tsx
    ├── platform/
    │   ├── layout.tsx
    │   ├── approvals/page.tsx
    │   ├── dashboard/page.tsx
    │   ├── fleet/page.tsx
    │   ├── installer/new/page.tsx
    │   ├── marketplace/
    │   ├── observability/page.tsx
    │   ├── runs/
    │   ├── security/page.tsx
    │   └── settings/page.tsx
    ├── reactivacion/page.tsx
    ├── rendimiento/page.tsx
    ├── runs/page.tsx
    ├── runs/[runId]/page.tsx
    ├── security/page.tsx
    ├── seguimiento/
    │   ├── page.tsx
    │   ├── formularios/page.tsx
    │   ├── confirmaciones/page.tsx
    │   └── huecos/page.tsx
    └── settings/page.tsx
```

The `proxy.ts` file protects `/app/*` traffic, keeps authenticated users away
from the login and register pages, and preserves public access to the
`demo-workspace` tenant.

`app/app/[tenantId]/layout.tsx` is the experience switch. It resolves the shell
using `tenant.settings.verticalClinicUi` as the canonical signal and falls back
to a loaded `clinic_profile` for older payloads. Clinical tenants render:

- `ClinicShell` for `dashboard` (`Resumen`), `bandeja`, `agenda`, `pacientes`,
  `seguimiento/*`, `reactivacion`, `rendimiento`, and `configuracion`
- `AgentmouShell` only for `/platform/*`
- redirects from legacy platform roots like `/runs` or `/marketplace` into
  `/platform/*`

Non-clinic tenants keep the original `AgentmouShell` and legacy root routes.
`clinicDentalMode` travels in the same tenant settings payload so the web app
does not need ad hoc heuristics to recognize the vertical before rendering
navigation.

### Next.js API routes

```text
app/api/
├── chat/route.ts
└── public-catalog/route.ts
```

- `chat` is the frontend-owned route for the public chat experience.
- `public-catalog` returns the curated catalog cards used on marketing pages.

## Data Access Model

The tenant control center uses a single `DataProvider` interface in
`lib/data/provider.ts`. There are three concrete modes:

| Provider | Mode | Used by | Backing source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mockProvider` | `mock` | Marketing layouts and synchronous mock reads | `lib/demo/read-model.ts` plus clinic demo read models |
| `demoProvider` | `demo` | `demo-workspace` tenant routes | Demo catalog plus operational and clinic overlays |
| `apiProvider` | `api` | Authenticated real tenants | `services/api` through `lib/api/client.ts` and `lib/api/clinic.ts` |

This separation lets the UI keep a stable shape while some surfaces are fully
live and others are still demo-backed or read-only.

The clinic fetchers in `lib/api/clinic.ts` now sit under the same
`DataProvider` contract as the original control-plane fetchers. That keeps the
clinic shell, the demo tenant, and mock-backed tests on the same frontend read
surface without page-level `fetch` calls.

## Important Supporting Modules

- `lib/api/core.ts` centralizes request/error helpers shared by all web API
  clients.
- `lib/api/client.ts` remains the typed fetcher layer for the original control
  plane.
- `lib/api/clinic.ts` adds typed fetchers for clinic dashboard, profile,
  modules, channels, patients, conversations, calls, appointments, forms,
  follow-up, and reactivation. It also parses structured `409`
  `clinic_feature_unavailable` responses into a dedicated client error.
- `lib/auth/` owns cookie hydration, auth requests, and the active tenant store.
- `lib/data/` contains the provider abstraction, clinic/provider adapters, and
  tenant dashboard metric helpers.
- `lib/tenant-experience.tsx` resolves shell mode, clinic capability flags,
  internal-platform access, and clinic fallbacks from tenant state.
- `components/clinic/` contains the reusable domain UI used by the clinic
  shell, including `ClinicShell`, `ClinicSidebar`, `ClinicTopbar`,
  `ClinicCommandSurface`, domain cards, and `InternalModeSwitch`.
- `components/control-plane/legacy-platform-redirect.tsx` moves clinic tenants
  from legacy platform roots into `/platform/*`.
- `lib/demo-catalog/` stores the curated demo inventory, featured marketing
  IDs, and the generated operational ID index.
- `lib/demo/clinic-read-model.ts` provides deterministic clinic fixtures for
  `mockProvider` and the demo tenant overlays.
- `lib/marketing/featured-from-demo.ts` builds the homepage catalog payload.
- `lib/honest-ui/` centralizes preview and placeholder labeling for the UI.
- `lib/search-index.ts` and the command palette now support `clinic` and
  `platform` modes so the clinic shell surfaces patients, appointments,
  conversations, forms, gaps, and campaigns instead of marketplace and runs.
- `components/` groups reusable UI and domain components used across the app.

## How It Fits Into The Platform

- `apps/web` never executes agents or workflows directly.
- `services/api` remains the source of truth for tenant data, installations,
  approvals, runs, connectors, billing, and security.
- `services/api` also supplies the clinic-domain backend read models that power
  the clinic shell.
- `packages/contracts` provides the shared types used by both the UI and the
  backend.
- `apps/web/lib/demo-catalog/` is intentionally separate from the operational
  manifests in `catalog/` and `workflows/`.
